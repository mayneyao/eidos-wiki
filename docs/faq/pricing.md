# Pricing

Eidos consistently adheres to the local-first philosophy, only charging for services that rely on the cloud. We aim to make our pricing model as simple and transparent as possible.

Eidos assigns privileges to licenses, and users can activate these licenses to obtain corresponding privileges. There are three types of licenses: free, one-time purchase, and subscription.

We provide open-source implementations for some of our paid services, allowing users to deploy them independently.

**Free**

Eidos's core is built on the web, and this part will always be free and open-source.

**One-Time Purchase**

Some advanced features are provided in the form of plugins or other formats. You can purchase these features for permanent use and access to the source code. This includes one year of code updates and technical support.

**Subscription**

Some services that rely on the cloud are provided in the form of subscriptions, such as the API service. We offer different subscription tiers to meet the needs of various users.
